### Hi there, I'm Cole! 👋

I'm a writer, student, and cat lover who lives in Indiana.

I'm currently working on a curriculum for diverse learners to understand the history of American contemporary literature.

Ask me about: cats, Nintendo, poetry, books, and Pokemon (and add me on Pokemon Go! ◓ 5309 4840 2357)
